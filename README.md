# Scope

In this repository, I've decided to implement various design patterns in PHP7 and Java in order to identify similarities between the two, but also to help out developers that may be transitioning from one to the other.

I try to find creative use cases for the patterns presented, and the I try to use the same naming/package conventions between the languages.

Design patterns implemented so far:

* Chain of Responsibility

# Installing and usage

## PHP 7

At the time of this writing, PHP7 is still way ahead of its release date, so there will probably be better installation tutorials in the future. For the time being, I've set up my development environment using the deps from [php7.zend.com](http://php7.zend.com/repo.php).

All PHP dependencies can be retrieved using Composer. The Composer version used when building the code was 1.0-dev.

## Java

All Java dependencies can be retrieved using Maven. The Maven version used when building the code was 3.0.5.
