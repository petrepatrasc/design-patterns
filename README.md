# Scope

In this repository, I've decided to implement various design patterns in PHP7 and Java in order to identify similarities between the two, but also to help out developers that may be transitioning from one to the other.

I try to find creative use cases for the patterns presented, and the I try to use the same naming/package conventions between the languages.

# Contributing

If you feel that this is interesting, want to do a code review on it or implement a new pattern yourself, you're more than welcome to submit an issue or pull request.
